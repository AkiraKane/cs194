An accurate eigenvalue is important for many numerical problems. On the other hand many large datasets are naturally noisy, and high precision isnt important. For SVD and PCA, we only want a few of the largest magnitude eigenvalues. For that we can use a much simpler method called the **Power Method**. If you've had a linear algebra course, you already know how to do this :-). \n",
